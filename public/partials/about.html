<p class="about opensans ">
This ports management tool is built mainly upon Play with scala, angularJs written in both javascript and coffeecript.<br/>All the data info are scrapyed from <a href="http://www.unece.org/cefact/locode/service/location.html">UNECE</a> by a python tool called <a href="http://scrapy.org/">Scrapy</a>. <br/>
To start off, please pick a country code that the port you're looking for is located in. Then you can do loads interesting things from there (At least I believe so...)<br/>
I really hope you can enjoy the time spent here, if not, then please enjoy your tea and sandwich...
